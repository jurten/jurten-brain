# Jurten's Brain
The aim of this project is to carefully select, share and preserve the most relevant ideas, projects and objectives I have, so it may serve some use to someone. My name is [[About Me|Joaquin Ignacio Olmos]] also known as [[About Me|Jurten]], and if you want to know more about this project, please stay, and read through some of my thoughts.

## Contents
The contents of this notes will be wildly unpredictable, as I will be sharing notes as I see fit. Nevertheless, it seems fit to share some of my most rooted fixations in order to inform you of what you will be able to find. In no order in particular I will proceed to list some of my favorite subjects, IT, AI, Fiction, Tabletop RPG's, Fantasy, SciFi, Movies, Books, History, Politics, Economics, and many, many others.

## Reading the Notes
I'm currently using a Github repo in order to version control this notes, however I aim to always make it available over at [brain.jurten.me](brain.jurten.me), so you can enjoy a more orderly and comfortable experience while reading.

## Suggestions
If you would like to share any suggestions you can either:
- HMU over Discord, my username is **jurten.** (yes, with a "." at the end).
- Or, you could raise and issue over Github.

## Future Improvements
If this notes turn out to be useful I will strive to order them and make a proper blog, where people can share their opinions right on it. But for the moment this will suffice.

## Acknowledgment
Many thanks to anyone who stumbles upon this and makes an effort to read it, I would be greatly pleased to see someone that shares my interest spend time reading into this note. And special thanks to the Quartz team for making the process of publishing so effortless.
